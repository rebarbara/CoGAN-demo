CoGAN is a system of neural networks that can be used to generate corresponding pairs (more generally, tuples) of images that share their high-level concepts. In the above example, a CoGAN was trained with images of handwritten digits ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, Yann LeCun) and color-inverted versions of them. A trained CoGAN can then be used to generate normal and color-inverted versions of the same digit.
